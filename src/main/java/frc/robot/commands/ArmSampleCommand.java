 * Set all gains to 0
 * Increase Kd until the system oscillates
 * Reduece Kd by a factor of 2-4
 * Set Kp to about 1% of Kd
 * Increase Kp until oscillations start
 * Decrease Kp by a factor of 2-4
 * Set Ki to about 1% of Kp
 * Increase Ki until oscillations start
 * Decrease Ki by a factor of 2-4
